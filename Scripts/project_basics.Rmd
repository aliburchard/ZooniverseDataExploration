launch_dates <- read.csv("../Data/working_project_launches.csv")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dataprep, echo = FALSE}
launch_dates %>% select(., counter, date, project, platform, type) %>% kable(.)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
launch_plot <- ggplot(data = launch_dates, aes(x = date, y = counter)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(colour = type)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = project, colour = type), vjust = "inward", hjust = "inward", size = 3)
  
launch_plot
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
